The application integrates the yfinance API to fetch real-time market data, analyst recommendations, and fundamental financial metrics (P/E, Market Cap, etc.). It features a sophisticated data pipeline using Pandas that loads a personal portfolio from Excel, performs all performance calculations (P/L, %), and handles multi-currency FX conversions (USD/ILS). The UI leverages Plotly for dynamic, interactive charting and Streamlit Session State to create a responsive, multi-view dashboard.",

This application models a 4f optical system, using NumPy to perform a 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on user-uploaded images (read via Pillow/OpenCV). This process projects the image into the frequency domain (Fourier plane). The user can then apply various computational masks (Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass) to directly manipulate the spatial frequencies. The final output is reconstructed via an Inverse FFT, visually demonstrating fundamental Image Processing techniques like real-time edge detection and blurring.",

This app leverages Computer Vision (OpenCV, Haar Cascades) to perform facial detection, extracting a raw rPPG (remote Photoplethysmography) signal. It then employs a robust Digital Signal Processing (DSP) pipeline using SciPy and NumPy for digital filtering (Butterworth Bandpass), Frequency-Domain Analysis (FFT/PSD) to determine heart rate, and Time-Domain Analysis to calculate HRV (RMSSD). All vitals are visualized dynamically using Plotly.",

The pipeline processes video with OpenCV, extracts 3D landmark coordinates, and uses NumPy for kinematic calculations (e.g., knee joint angles). The resulting biomechanical time-series signals are then visualized interactively using Plotly.",
